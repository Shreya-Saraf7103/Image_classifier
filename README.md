# Image_classifier
In this project image classifier we make a deep neural network model which tends to train our model on the available training set to diffrentiate and classify different images, which is then further used to predict the class of the given image more accurately.
We have also used random initialization of the required parameters, normalization, regularization, adam optimization and tf.GradientTape which records operations for differentation for more accurate and faster prediction.
